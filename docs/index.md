# Welcome to My CS 188 Learning Notes

---

Hello! This is **Hongyi Chen's** personal knowledge base.

This site was created to systematically organize and review the concepts I'm learning during my studies at UC Berkeley and beyond.

The core focus is on my course notes, especially for **CS 188 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)**. My goal is to build a solid and clear knowledge structure through continuous documentation, organization, and review.


## About This Site

!!! note "How This Site Is Built"

    This website is built and maintained by me using the following technologies:

    * **Content**: Written in plain `Markdown`
    * **Site Generator**: `MkDocs` with the `Material for MkDocs` theme
    * **Hosting & CI/CD**: `Git` & `GitHub Pages` for automated deployment

    This setup allows me to focus purely on the content of my notes, while the formatting, building, and publishing process is fully automated and highly efficient.
